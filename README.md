## Create Your Own Learning Path

I have a bunch of tutorials that I have been meaning to get through. 

Most of them are stored in a list of bookmarks that I keep rearranging. 

I also have a folder full of pdf's that I've been meaning to read. 

I even have a bunch of video that I paid good money for on a hard drive somewhere, which I completely forgot about.

I wanted to be able to arrange everything into a single timeline. 

A kind of curriculum or lesson plan. 

For some reason, when I put things on a timeline they are easier to think about.

I'm a developer, I'm using path to keep track of online coding tutorials but you can use it for any kind of lessons. 

When you add a step to your path, you can link to a book on amazon for example, or just name the step and not link to anything at all. It will keep track of all the steps you want to do and organise them into a clear learning path.
