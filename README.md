# Path

## Save and queue tutorials you want to do.

I have a bunch of tutorials that I have been meaning to get through. Most of them are stored in a list of bookmarks that I keep rearranging. I also have a folder full of pdf's that I've been meaning to read. I even have a bunch of video that I paid good money for on a hard drive somewhere, which I completely forgot about.

I wanted to be able to arrange everything into a single timeline. A kind of curriculum or lesson plan. For some reason, when I put things on a timeline they are easier to think about.

I am a developer and I am using path for online coding tutorials but you can use it for any kind of lessons. Wehn you create a step in your path, you could link to a book on amazon for example or not link to anything at all. It will keep track of all teh steps you want to do and organise them into a clear learning path.

If you'd like to be notified when Path is ready you can [sign up to my tinyletter](https://tinyletter.com/joshpitzalis) and I'll send out updates as it come together.

If you'd like to try Path while it's still in super beta mode you can [sign up here](https://path-1ba3e.firebaseapp.com/).
